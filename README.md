# Data-Science-Coursera
#### This repository contains all the exercises and projects carried out by me as part of the data science course offered by Johns Hopkins University through Coursera. 
#The Data Science courses are  
### _Data Scientist's Toolbox_
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;The data scientist's toolbox is used to set up the basic tools and gives the basic introduction to R, Rstudio, Markdown, Git and Github. In the Project assignment a repository is created with the markdown page in Github.
### _R-Programming_
####  &nbsp;&nbsp;  This course is used to learn about introduction of R Programming and how to use R for effective data analysis. This course covers practical issues in statistical computing which includes programming in R, reading data in R, accessing R packages, writing R function, debugging, Profiling R code, organizing and comminting R code.In the Project assignment the hospital quality of care at over 4000 meadicare-certified hospitals in the U.S. data is given. 
#### Written R program for 
####* Finding the best hospital in the state.
####* Ranking hospitals by outcome in a state.
####* Ranking hospitals in all states.
### _Getting and Cleaning Data_
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  This course will cover the basic ways that data can be obtained. The course will cover obtaining data from the web, from APIs, from databases and from colleagues in various formats. It will also cover the basics of data cleaning and how to make data “tidy”. Tidy data dramatically speed downstream data analysis tasks. The course will cover the basics needed for collecting, cleaning, and sharing data.In the project assignment, Testing data Sumsung phone using for 30 pepole in five activities(Sitting,Walking,Laying,Walking Up and Walking down). The Raw data to tidy data several processes is included they are raw data, processing instructions, codebooks, and processed data 
### _Exploratory Data Analysis_
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This course covers the essential exploratory techniques for summarizing data. Exploratory techniques are important for eliminating or sharpening potential hypotheses about the world that can be addressed by the data. It covers the plotting systems in R as well as some of the basic principles of constructing data graphics. In the project assignment Emission value for four years in the U.S data.
####Plotting are made for the following  
####* Yearly total emission in the U.S
####* Yearly total emission in the Baltimore city
####* Emission for various source in the Baltimore city
####* Yearly total emission for coal combusion-related source
####* Total emission for motor vehicle sources in the Baltimore city
####* Total emission for motor vehical sources for the both Baltimore city and Los Angeles County
